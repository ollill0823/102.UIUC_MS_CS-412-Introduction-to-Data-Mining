### CSV file:
- [2023 MLB pitching raw data](https://github.com/ollill0823/102.UIUC_MS_CS-412-Introduction-to-Data-Mining/tree/main/Report) Raw data from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search)


### Jupyter notebook

- I have chosen the [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) problem as my final project. There have been [rumors](https://michaelturton.blogspot.com/2008/02/gerrymandering.html) about several districts experiencing unbiased re-arrangement in Taiwan 20 years ago. The second district in Taichung is one of the most apparent examples. The district is unique in Taiwan because it connects coastal areas, urban residential areas, and mountain areas. The goal of this project is to use **Gurobi** to find the optimal distribution and then compare it with the current situation. If the simulation meets our expectations, we can suggest that the rumor is convincing. Additionally, we aim to explore how controlling the re-arrangement could impact the drawing of boundaries to secure the best legislator votes. We will utilize the 2018 legislator votes as our dataset. Within the analysis, we will classify the votes into two major groups: [the DPP and the KMT party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Yuan_constituencies_in_Taichung_City).
   - **Results**:
      - 001. [Re-distribution](https://github.com/ollill0823/101.UIUC_MS_IE-532-Analysis-of-Network-Data/blob/main/005.Final_project/Pictures/chapter4.png)
      - 002. [Benefits to the DPP party](https://github.com/ollill0823/101.UIUC_MS_IE-532-Analysis-of-Network-Data/blob/main/005.Final_project/Pictures/chapter5.png)
      - 003. [Benefits to the KMT party](https://github.com/ollill0823/101.UIUC_MS_IE-532-Analysis-of-Network-Data/blob/main/005.Final_project/Pictures/chapter6.png)
   - **Another finding in gurobi**:
      - 004. [Can only be allowed if and only if one objective function](https://github.com/ollill0823/101.UIUC_MS_IE-532-Analysis-of-Network-Data/blob/main/005.Final_project/Pictures/obj_issue.png)
